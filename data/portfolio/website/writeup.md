## This Website

Yes, _this_ website. Very meta, we know. Four years overdue, but better late than never, right?

The new site is really simple (designing for yourself is hard, it turns out), but this serves as a nice foundation for us to build upon and grow. If, for whatever strange reason, you miss the stodgy past, you can still check out [our old site](http://classic.byimplication.com).
