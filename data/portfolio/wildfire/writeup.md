## Wildfire

Our very first project, and what put us on the map.

Wildfire is a game about saving the world. Opponents like rampant poverty, gender inequality, inadequate education and environmental degradation cannot be defeated by marching armies, secret potions or magic swords. This is a game about how they can be defeated: through volunteerism, social interaction and nonviolent activism.

Inspired by the events of Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana), Wildfire was an entry to Microsoft's Imagine Cup in 2010, where we represented the Philippines in the worldwide finals in Poland. The game went on to win first prize in the Game Design category.
