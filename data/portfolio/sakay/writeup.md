Transit directions for Jeepneys, Buses, Trains, and more (soon!) in Metro Manila. Like Google Maps or Waze, but for commuting!

Originally built by [Thomas](http://pleasantprogrammer.com) and [Phi](http://twitter.com/_phi) as a small side project. Sakay.ph was also an entry to the [Philippine Transit App Challenge](http://www.gov.ph/2013/10/13/dotc-sets-philippine-transit-app-challenge-awards-night/) in 2013, where it won the [Open Community Award](https://www.techinasia.com/5-apps-find-philippine-transit-app-challenge/). ðŸŽ‰

In February 2015, we relaunched with new branding, a new interface, and mobile apps.

The app and website are very well-received; we've served over 500,000 users so far, and have been featured in the news several times.
