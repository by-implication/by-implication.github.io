## Sakay.ph

Transit directions for Jeepneys, Buses, Trains, and more (soon!) in Metro Manila. Like Google Maps or Waze, but for commuting!

Originally built by Thomas and Phi as a side project. Sakay.ph was an entry to the [Philippine Transit App Challenge](http://www.gov.ph/2013/10/13/dotc-sets-philippine-transit-app-challenge-awards-night/) in 2013, where it won the [Open Community Award](https://www.techinasia.com/5-apps-find-philippine-transit-app-challenge/). ðŸŽ‰

In February 2015, we relaunched with new branding, a new interface, and mobile apps.
