## Open Reconstruction

[Open Reconstruction](http://openreconstruction.gov.ph) was built for the Philippine Governmentâ€™s [Department of Budget Management](http://www.dbm.gov.ph), with funding and guidance from the [World Bank](http://www.mb.com.ph/300-m-world-bank-loan-to-boost-ph-infrastructure-education-job-creation/), in line with the [Open Data Initiative](http://data.gov.ph/).

### Government Portal

It provides a means for NGAs, GOCCs, and LGUs to easily make calamity funding requests for projects, and track them through the approval process, ideally up until execution and implementation.

### Public Dashboard

The site also allows the public to track progress of projects and requests, search and filter these entries by location, type, or disaster, share these projects via social media, and leave comments on entries. Reports, visualizations, and infographics are also automatically generated by the system, based on real-time stats from the database.

### Open Source

Open Reconstruction is an open source project, and you can tinker with the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/by-implication/Open-Reconstruction)!
