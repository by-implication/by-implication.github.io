## Open Reconstruction

[Open Reconstruction](http://openreconstruction.gov.ph) was built for the Philippine Governmentâ€™s [Department of Budget Management](http://www.dbm.gov.ph), with funding and guidance from the [World Bank](http://www.mb.com.ph/300-m-world-bank-loan-to-boost-ph-infrastructure-education-job-creation/), in line with the [Open Data Initiative](http://data.gov.ph/).

### Government Portal

It aims to provide a means to NGAs, GOCCs, and LGUs to easily *request for calamity funds* and keep track of the same as it goes through the *approval process*, ideally up until the *execution and implementation* of the project(s).

### Public Dashboard

In addition, the site will also allow the *public* to track progress of projects and requests, *search and filter* these entries by location, type, or disaster, share these projects via social media, and leave comments on entries. *Reports, visualizations, and infographics* are also automatically generated by the system, based on real-time stats from the database.

### Open Source

Open Reconstruction is an open source project, and you can tinker with the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/by-implication/Open-Reconstruction)!
