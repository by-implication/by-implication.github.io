#The By Implication Website
The portfolio and public-facing site of By Implication. 
##Background
Four years overdue, and it's finally here. And yet, this is still something of a temporary website. (But then again, so was the original.) This context provided a good number of constraints to work with: time couldn't be wasted on pretty complexities; no parallax, no fancy toolbar animations based on scroll position; everything had to be simple, clean, and responsive.
